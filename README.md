## Overview

**Turtle Tracer** is a powerful desktop application built with Electron and Svelte, designed to revolutionize how FIRST Tech Challenge teams plan their autonomous routines.

Unlike web-based alternatives, Turtle Tracer runs **natively on your machine**. This means superior performance, actual local file management, offline capabilities, and deep integration with your team's Git workflow.

---

## Unmatched Features

Turtle Tracer isn't just a port of the web tool—it's a complete reimagining of what path planning should be.

### Next-Level Performance & Workflow

- **Native Desktop Experience:** Blazing fast performance that works offline and integrates smoothly with your OS.
- **Robust History:** Never lose progress with Auto-Save, full Undo/Redo support, and a dedicated History Panel.
- **Git Integration:** See file status (Modified, Staged, Untracked) instantly. Version control your paths alongside your robot code.

  <img src="README_Content/SomeFeatures.gif" alt="GIF of some great features!" />

### Professional Analysis & Simulation

- **Telemetry Overlay:** Import real robot log data to see exactly how your path performed on the field compared to the plan.
- **Physics-Based Simulation:** Real-time kinematics simulation with accurate velocity constraints and acceleration profiles.
- **Heatmaps & Stats:** Visualize robot velocity along the path with color-coded gradients, Velocity Graphs, and Timing breakdowns.

### Powerful Planning Tools

- **File Macros:** Reuse successful path sequences! Drag and drop `.turt` or legacy `.pp` files to use them as sub-routines (macros).
- **Smart Validators:** Get real-time feedback on Obstacles, Keep-In Zones, and continuous path safety validation.
- **Path Optimizer:** Single-click optimization to refine paths for maximum speed while respecting field boundaries.

  <img src="README_Content/CommandPallete.png" alt="Screenshot showing the Command Palette (Cmd+K)" />

### UI & Efficiency Boosters

- **Command Palette:** Press `Cmd+K` (or `Ctrl+K`) to instantly search for paths, settings, or commands.
- **Custom Field Maps:** Import any field image with the built-in Calibration Wizard.
- **Robot Profile Manager:** Manage multiple robot configurations with unique dimensions and constraints.

1. Download the `.deb` or `.AppImage` from <a href="https://github.com/Mallen220/TurtleTracer/releases">Releases</a>.<br>
2. For AppImage, grant execution permissions:<br>
   <code>chmod +x TurtleTracer*.AppImage</code><br>
   <code>./TurtleTracer*.AppImage</code><br>
3. Ensure you have <code>libfuse2</code> and <code>zlib1g</code> installed via your package manager.
</details>

## Workflow & File Management

One of the critical advantages of Turtle Tracer over web-based tools is its **Local File Management system**.

- **Security & Persistence:** Paths are saved as actual `.turt` files on your hard drive—not in a fragile browser cache.
- **Version Control Friendly:** Easily commit `.turt` files to Git alongside your robot's Java code.
- **Built-in Organizer:** Use the native file browser to organize folders, duplicate routines, and manage backups without leaving the app.

## Exporting Your Paths

  <img src="README_Content/LiveCodePreview.gif" alt="GIF of the Live Code Preview panel" />

The visualizer provides flexible export capabilities for any team's workflow:

1. **Java Class:** Generates a complete, ready-to-run Java file for your FTC robot controller (`TurtleTracerLib` compliant).
2. **Sequential Commands:** Exports code formatted for command-based frameworks.
3. **Strategy Sheet:** Export a printable summary of your routine for strategizing with alliance partners.
4. **Visual Media:** Export high-quality **APNG**, **GIF**, and **Static Images** of your paths for engineering notebooks.

</p>

## Troubleshooting

- **macOS "App is damaged" error:** macOS requires you to un-quarantine manually installed apps. Run: `sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Turtle Tracer.app"`
- **Windows SmartScreen warning:** Click "More Info" and then "Run Anyway". The code is fully open-source and safe.
- **Linux AppImage won't run:** Ensure `libfuse2` is installed and the file has execution permissions (`chmod +x`).
